## About me

I create open tools for global collaboration and local manufacturing. Some of my core projects are:

 - [Fabricatable Machines](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/wiki) - a system for building custom digital fabrication machines with a high degree of self fabricated parts. Our first [paper](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/publications/Fabricatable%20Machines%20-%20A%20Toolkit%20for%20Building%20DigitalFabrication%20Machines%20-%20TEI202.pdf) from the project was published at TEI202

 - [Bark Beetle](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/Bark-beetle-parametric-toolpaths/blob/master/README.md) - CAM for creating CNC milling toolpaths with Rhino and Grasshopper and embeding in parametric objects

 - [Making Living Sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geu_GuJQz8S8bz9bmdWiVUWyAENWw7ce/view?usp=sharing) - a 40min research documentary on open design, global collaboration and local manufacturing

I am a strong beliver in reducing artifcial scarcity in all domains of human life. Collaboration and "the greater good" argument of openly published research, design and software are very important to me. I believe that the majority of human challenges on earth are caused more by mental and interhuman challenges, than a lack of technological progess and inventions. By contributing to making digital fabrication and self fabrication of custom automation equipment more available _(both pracictaclly and mentally)_, while contributing to global knowledge sharing, I hope to help more people follow their dreams and feel more connected to humanity. I also hope to contribute to the reduction the digital divide and rising inequality in wealth distribution.

I am not employed by an academic instution or company, but work independently while collaborating informally with many peers. I aim to increase the time spent doing this work and its impact with the help of my freshly launched [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/jensdyvik).

I am a former fab lab nomad and a co-founder of [Fellesverkstedet](https://www.fellesverkstedet.no/facilities) one of the worlds most comprehensive independent Fab Labs.

## My role in MAS.865.21 and term project

I am honoured and excited to have been invited to sit in during the 2021 winter/spring class of _How to Make Something that Makes (almost) Anything_. I am available as a resource, but also aim to do the weekly assignments.

I have recently started renting a 21m2 studio _(in the building of Fellesverksted, the Fab Lab that i co-created in Oslo, Norway)_. Inside this studio am building a cartesian reserach platform with a roughly 7m3 work volume. The machine will have a heavy-duty tool changing system to allow me to experiment and develop new fabrication workflows, while understanding more about automation. My three main research areas are:

 - Making large format digital fabrication more accesible
 
 - Making sustainable materials and local material loops more accesible
 
 - Making automation more accesible _(combining additive and subtractive manufacturing, pick and place with grippers/vacuum, automatic loading of stock and packing of finished parts and lots more)_
 
I plan to use this course to boost the develpoment of this large dream research platfrom machine and benfit from the exchange of insights and best practices with fellow machine builders.
