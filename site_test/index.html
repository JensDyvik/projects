### About me
I create open tools for global collaboration and local manufacturing. Some of my core projects are:
- [Fabricatable Machines](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/wiki) - a system for building custom digital fabrication machines with a high degree of self fabricated parts. Our first [paper](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/raw/master/publications/Fabricatable%20Machines%20-%20A%20Toolkit%20for%20Building%20DigitalFabrication%20Machines%20-%20TEI202.pdf) from the project was published at TEI202
- [Bark Beetle](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/Bark-beetle-parametric-toolpaths/blob/master/README.md) - CAM for creating CNC milling toolpaths with Rhino and Grasshopper and embeding in parametric objects
- [Making Living Sharing)(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1geu_GuJQz8S8bz9bmdWiVUWyAENWw7ce/view?usp=sharing) - a 40min research documentary on open design, global collaboration and local manufacturing

I am a strong beliver in reducing artifcial scarcity in all domins of human life. Collaboration and "the greater good" argument of openly published research, design and software are very important to me. I believe that the majority of human challenges on earth are caused more by mental and interhuman challenges than a lack of technological progess and inventions. By making digital fabrication and custom automation equipement making more available _(both pracictaclly and mentally)_ to everyday citizens of earth while contributing to global knowledge sharing, I hope to help more people follow their dreams, feel connected to humanity as well reduce the digital divide and rising inequality in wealth distribution.

I am not employed by an academic instution or company, but work independently while colobarating informally with many peers. I aim to fund my work throug my [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/jensdyvik).

I am a former fab lab nomad and a co-founder of [Fellesverkstedet](https://www.fellesverkstedet.no/facilities) one of the worlds most comprehensive independent Fab Labs.
